## Abstract

__VISION__ üëæ

Life progress has directed us to the discovery of a new decentralized world of technologies.

The world will be fully adapted to blockchain technology.
The fundamentals of this progress are Bitcoin and Ethereum.
They will be often used by Innovative and New Decentralized Companies.

New  WEB 3.0 technologies gave a start to such new Internet concepts:
- Parties cooperate directly without intermediaries;
- Users possess much more control over their personal information;
- Anyone can use Internet anywhere, because of its ubiquitousness;
- The semantic web made user search more efficient.

The first blockchain was introduced 12 years ago. Nowadays, bitcoin credibility can be calculated at $1 trillion and 100 million of its users. The trust to the bitcoin blockchain is a result of the safe, protected, fast, and beneficial technology for the economy and trading value demonstrated during all 13 years. 


We deal with the next challenges:

- lack of Bitcoin ecosystem for users mass adoption;
- lack of trusted, user friendly tools to execute essential blockchain activities;
- centralized management of the companies;
- few information about blockchain use cases in a real life;

We introduce Truth Machine - a simple tool for recording data into blockchains and a NITDAO - smart contracts builder with the programmable digital statute. Also we work on bringing blockchain for mass adoption by researching, structuring information and guidelines about web 3.0 technologies.

__Our goal is to make new technologies accessible, simple to use, and clear__

## Market overview and NfX

The global blockchain technology market size was valued at USD 3.67 billion in 2020. It is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 82.4% from 2021 to 2028. Blockchain has emerged as a highly promising technology in the IT domain. It is an open, immutable, distributed public ledger that can be accessed by several parties involved in the transaction and acts as a universal depository of all transactions between the involved parties. The increasing acceptance of cryptocurrency worldwide is one of the major factors driving market growth. Commercial and central banks across the world are now using blockchain technology for payment processing and issuing of their digital currencies. The technology enables cross-border payments that are less expensive and faster as compared to traditional systems.

![NIT](https://github.com/nitnetwork/papers/blob/main/img/NIT_marketsize.png "New Information Technologies")

The remittance cost within the blockchain is 2% to 3% of the total amount as compared to other third parties as blockchain does not require third-party authentication. Various financial service and solution providers are entering into partnerships with blockchain solution providers to enhance their cross-border payment processes. For instance, in September 2019, Mastercard announced its partnership with R3, an enterprise blockchain software provider, to develop a blockchain-enabled cross-border payment solution.
The traditional stock exchange involves a lot of bureaucracy and stages and thereby, requires three days for processing. However, blockchain technology's decentralization nature in banking removes unnecessary intermediates and enables trade to be run on computers globally. At the same time, blockchain helps improve performance by reducing the redundancy of information in trading transactions. Various financial service providers use blockchain technology for enhancing their stock exchange processes. For instance, in January 2021, SBI Holdings, based in Japan, partnered with Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group to launch a digital stock exchange in the country by 2022.
The increasing global demand for digital payment systems is driving the market growth in the current days. Digital payment relies on multiple parties to process transactions, including merchant banks, retail banks, card issuers, and payments software companies, which creates the demand for blockchain technology to secure the transactions. Simultaneously, the reliability of users on trusted institutions to complete their day-to-day electronic transactions is also creating the demand for blockchain technology.

__NfX__
![NIT](https://github.com/nitnetwork/papers/blob/main/img/NIT_NfX_BTC.jpeg "New Information Technologies")

Crypto changes the nature of money in a historical way, because unlike gold or paper money, crypto is a native creature of the new global network. That gives it unfair powers from the future. Unlike fiat currencies, it isn‚Äôt constrained by geography or time. Unlike fiat currencies, it‚Äôs programmable and can be improved quickly in response to market needs. Most importantly, software-money more easily amplifies the ‚Äúbelief‚Äù network effect that gave older forms of currency power, since today the world is more connected and shared, beliefs spread faster in higher densities.


## Technology

__Overview__

Our target is to maximize the adoption of blockchain technology. All leading blockchains have been chosen to give users a right to choose. Currently, we are examining the primary 4 blockchains and have determined a plan to implement our DAO model and data recording (certification) step by step in each particular protocol.

Let‚Äôs begin with the first one - __Bitcoin__.

Further we have the plan to consolidate the solution into all progressive blockchain technologies:
- Ethereum;
- Polygon;
- Near.

Bitcoin is the first blockchain, it is the most trusted and reliable. Currently, the cryptocurrency community is considering and maintaining new technologies in other blockchains mostly because they have more enhanced ecosystems, communities, guides, and samples. This makes possible to engage more developers, enthusiasts, and investors.

But if we (human beings) have to move massively into the crypto-economy, use crypto every single day and establish decentralized organizations, companies, institutions, and states,
then what technology could we trust to do it all? Bitcoin? Let's begin with it ...
Bitcoin has proven to be a reliable, secure, quick, and comfortable technology for saving and exchanging value.

Special credit to Satoshi Nakamoto and Vitalik Buterin for establishing reasons to begin thinking about these matters.

In addition, we will take a detailed look at the base modules of the NIT protocol, their characterization, application, and business model.

A DAO is a self-organizing community with decentralized and automatically executable administration and voting, financial administration, participation, earnings, and workflow organization functions via blockchain.

A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a new organizational form. It allows resources to be coordinated through decentralized and provably neutral instruments. The DAO is not a complete replacement for corporations. Nevertheless, it gives an alternative for a lot of organization types that can profit from a programmable model of administration and decentralization: corporations, cooperatives, religious organizations, schools, NGOs, government agencies and departments, and local communities. [V. Buterin, 2020](6)

The blockchain properties arrange unique abilities to establish
and manage decentralized organizations, along with the records immutability, clarity, and speed of transactions.

__Script + Lightning__:

Bitcoin's language of scripting enables a diversity of smart contracts;
such layers as Lightning Network and sidechains open more opportunities for smart contracts in Bitcoin;
the Taproot update has enlarged the flexibility, productivity, and practicability of smart contract features for Bitcoin.

:zap: A bitcoin smart contract ‚Äì what is it?  

It is a digital agreement that is accomplished automatically and is based on predefined criteria. For instance, a smart contract can determine that bitcoins must be automatically sent between users after a certain time delay.
Smart contracts can be exceptionally complicated and include different conditional criteria, or they can be as elementary as requiring a digital signature to spend money.

:zap: How Bitcoin Executes Smart Contracts

The Bitcoin network supports a broad scope of smart contracts using its powerful scripting language which is called Script. Script allows users to determine criteria for spending their bitcoins, and bitcoin transactions tie certain amounts of bitcoins to those scripts. The user must meet these criteria to be able to spend the bitcoin tied to the script. As follows, all bitcoin transactions are smart contracts.
The spending criteria are named scriptPubKey or blocking script. The information and script that meet the criteria are named ScriptSig or ScriptWitness, depending on the input usage of SegWit.

:zap: Bitcoin script and Turing integrity

Script has been effective for powering the Bitcoin network for over ten years, but it is not Turing-complete - it does not provide logical loops. This feature protects the Bitcoin network from the denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, experienced by other cryptocurrency networks.

:zap: Different types of Bitcoin smart contracts

Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH) is a very well-known type of the Bitcoin script. It allows to send bitcoins to a bitcoin address, so solely the corresponding private key owner is able to spend the bitcoin.
On a technical level, P2PKH scripts set a strict requirement: to spend bitcoins, the user has to provide an ECDSA signature that matches with the public key whose hash is specified by the script. Since an acceptable signature can only be created by the owner of the private key that matches the hash of the public key, the bitcoin is exclusively owned by the owner of the private key.

:zap: Leaders among Bitcoin Smart Contracts

Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash is one of the simplest Bitcoin smart contracts, but it is the most famous because of its practicability and simplicity. Also, it is possible to use more difficult smart contracts, using the Bitcoin script, and there are many more at further levels.

:zap: Multi-signature scripts

Multi-signature scripts may need any number of signatures, which can belong to any number of users, while P2PKH scripts need just a single signature. They work as follows: a list of n public keys and a number m, which is less than or equivalent to n, is given. Bitcoins bound to this script may be spent just if m signatures are provided, each of them corresponding to one of the public keys which is the n listed. This design is known as an m-of-n multi-signature.

One common multi-signature setting is 2-of-3 and needs two signatures from a group with three public keys. The three parties are able to keep their money together, making sure that neither party can steal the assets or prevent the majority spending them as they see fit. Multisignature 2-of-3 is used by decentralized services, for escrow with minimum trust.

:zap: Time-locked bitcoin transactions

The transactions may be time-locked. They are valid only after a specific period of time has passed. In addition, they can be used as the element of blockchain scripts to adjust requirements for bitcoin spending. So, a script may need three signatures to spend bitcoins before a specified time, after which just a single signature is required. This makes backups possible, perfectly preventing the funds‚Äô loss.

:zap: Pay-as-you-go scripted hash (P2SH)

Arbitrarily complicated scenarios became possible because of the standard known as the Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH), as it was enlarged to include P2WSH as a part of the SegWit update. P2SH and P2WSH smart contracts allow the user to send bitcoins to any script hash, like any of the above examples. This design allows lowering to the minimum the cost of sending Bitcoins in a complex smart contract. Additionally, it gives more privacy until it is spent.

:zap: Taproot and Bitcoin Smart Contracts

The update of the Taproot's Bitcoin will announce a new script type. It is known as Pay-to-Taproot (P2TR), which will merge functions of the P2PKH and P2SH scripts allowing to send bitcoins to both public key and arbitrary scripts. Nevertheless, in contrast to P2SH and P2WSH, allowing Bitcoins sending to a single script, P2TR uses Merkelized Alternative Script Trees (MAST) to allow bitcoins to be sent to 2^128 separate arbitrary scripts. For spending bitcoins, any of these scenarios is possible to be used. The Bitcoin Taproot update creates substantial flexibility for Bitcoin users to build complex smart contracts in the Bitcoin chain. In addition, it provides expanded fulfillment and privacy for Lightning channels, which are a type of smart contract.

__Smart contracts levels on top of Bitcoins__

All mentioned smart contracts are executed on the Bitcoin blockchain as regular Bitcoin transactions. Nonetheless, they may be spent and used to power smart contracts on the next levels, for example, Lighting Network.

:zap: Lighting Network :zap:

It uses transactions with multiple signatures to arrange quick and almost free Bitcoin payments. They are known as time-locked hashed contracts (HTLCs). They enable Bitcoin payments between several participants without trust, assuring that each user assisting the payment transaction receives a small compensation.

:zap: Further Bitcoin Levels.

Lighting Network is just one of the large variety of protocols that enables Bitcoins to be transferred off-line. The rest, including Liquid Network, and chains (side and state), are also dependable on Bitcoin's capacity to smart contracts for providing more of use cases. With the continuing expansion of Bitcoin, we will be witnessing an increasing amount of approaches to use Bitcoin, an asset or another network. Nevertheless, all these solutions will remain to be tied to the Bitcoin blockchain security, and most of them will continue to strongly count on Bitcoin's powerful scripting language.


### __NIT DAO + Smart Contract Builder__

This is a simple and easy-to-use constructor of decentralized organizations and smart contracts. The constructor includes essential and basic functions: multi-signing, voting, algorithmic spending of funds in treasuries, and capital programming.

![NIT](https://github.com/nitnetwork/NIT-Documentation/blob/main/UIUX/DAO/DAO.%20Organisation.png)

NIT DAO arranges a web interface for simple organization building. All users only need to open a web page and click buttons following the instructions. The functions of building a new DAO, determining a new DAO template, storing, distributing, and withdrawing personal assets, voting in DAO, etc will be provided by the builder.

In the NIT DAO Builder, you can create a digital status for your organization. The Builder defines the distribution of funds, assigns shareholders, and determines the types of decisions to be made.

__Instructions for DAO building__

Choice of organization template:
- a public, nonprofit organization;
- a public company;
- a private company.

:white_circle: Main Information:
Selecting organization name (DAO ID: It will be an exclusive identifier for your DAO, and will be a  part of the URL for direct access to your DAO), e.g. new_information_technologies

1. Fill out the token information for community use to maintain your DAO:
the token name or title, such as ‚ÄúNewInformationTechnologies‚Äù;
token Ticker, for example, ‚ÄúXNIT‚Äù;
the number of tokens to be issued.

:white_circle: Configuration:

2. Delay In Execution. The period while any transaction in your DAO will be accessible for the challenge by your members in advance of execution.

3. Rules / Agreement.
Your DAO has positive abilities - transactions can appear without voting, but under agreed rules. Provide a fundamental agreement for your DAO (in text or uploaded file). You can use and edit the following text as necessary, or use this template to create a more completed agreement.

:white_circle: Collateral.
Collateral is needed for setting up or disputing any transaction. XNIT is the default currency for collateral. If you want to override the default, you need to define a separate contract address or use a new DAO token.

4. Set up the execution of security token:
establish a new contract/token or choose the XDAO token;
determine the address*(if it is a new token) (after DAO creation, the XDAO token address will be identified);
the number of tokens.

5. Collateral call token:
establish a new contract/token or choose the XDAO token;
determine address*(if t is a new token) (after DAO creation, the XDAO token address will be identified);
the number of tokens.

6. Whitelist addresses that can set up transactions.
Reduce the number of addresses that can set up transactions. Note: Your DAO will be blocked if these addresses are wrong or unavailable. In case you select "Any Address", everyone will have the opportunity to set up transactions in your DAO. Please make sure that you understand the results of this choice.

:white_circle: Allocation

Allocation helps you automatize funds distribution between treasuries/addresses and build their specifications.

7. The primary addresses of the acceptance pool.
External/public addresses for payments accepting.

8. Addresses for distribution.
Internal/private addresses for storage and distribution.
 
9. Settings of distribution.
Define distribution addresses, voting percentage, and quorum.

10. Settings of storage.
Define cold time and voting quorum.

11. Settings of multi-signature.
Define multi-signature addresses.


### __Truth machine__

From the creation of the blockchain and the popular title that Satoshi chose to record as the first permanent notice on the blockchain, Bitcoin has been operated as a platform for freedom of speech. Also, in addition to the exchange of digital currency on a global level, Bitcoin gives its users the ability to publish data that is not subject to censorship or cancellation and will be available to the world while Bitcoin exists (since one copy or node exists, maybe forever). Everyone sees the abilities and usage of Bitcoin differently. Moreover, we are predisposed to consider that the data entry can be a legitimate and cost-effective use of the blockchain.

It is commonly known that the blockchain can store external information. There are a lot of websites that give access to some of this information. Some excellent searchers have found several interesting historical antiques that were stored on the blockchain a long time ago. Nevertheless, there is still embarrassment and falsification about the different forms of information storage (possible and existent). As for now, there is no appropriate way to allocate arbitrary data to the Bitcoin blockchain. There is a need for simple and easy-to-understand interfaces. This is where we decided to begin.

We introduce to you Truth machine ‚Äì the system for text recording and reading to Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. Additionally, it‚Äôs intended to verify and deposit, using the technology of decentralized blockchain and IPFS. 

Standard Scripts-Bitcoin's stack-based scripting language for creation of transaction is known as "Script."
Bitcoin transactions contain input and output scripts. Input scripts are solutions (unlocking scripts) to prior output scripts (blocking scripts) in previous transactions stored in the blockchain. Currently, there are 5 standard script types, which are used and allowed for transactions in the Bitcoin network. The standard script types include Pay-to-Public-Key (P2PK), Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH), Multi-Signature, Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH) and OP_RETURN (see Appendix B for script formats). Each of them can be used to store arbitrary data in the Bitcoin blockchain.

__Data Hash Method__ - is a more practical method of entering information into the Blockchain. 
Identical to the Data Drop method, the input script preceding the Redeem Script includes duplicated chunks of <Data>...<Data>.

The format of the Redeem Script:
OP_HASH160 <DataElementHash> OP_EQUALVERIFY
These three commands are then duplicated for each information element that is pushed into the stack using the input script. Instead of simply dropping each data component off the stack, this script uses hashes to confirm that each chunk of data has not been falsified. Because the hashes are stored in the Redeem Script, and the hash of the Redeem Script was recorded in the first stage UTXO, no other data can be replaced with the input script that spends this UTXO, even if these transaction inputs were not signed. Despite it, signing each input (by including <Sig> at the beginning of the input script and <PubKey> OP_CHECKSIG at the end of the Redeem Script) is still important to prevent an adversary from possible disorganizing the inputs, or adding a subset of the inputs, in a competing transaction. These security issues are further explained in the next section.

The function module has 3 major tasks:
1. Recording;
2. Reading;
3. Verification (in progress).

  
 :key: __WRITE__ 

Working with __tr.m NIT__:

Library installation which is able to communicate with bitcoin-cli;
https://www.npmjs.com/package/blockchaindata-lib;
Code writing in Node.js to write text into a blockchain that will read information from a text file.

The maximum size of the file is ~65 Kilobytes.

After a succeeded write operation hash will be returned to the transaction, including our document, tightened by deflating algorithm by the zlib library.

It took 0.00058288 BTC to record two files
($18 as of July 17, 2021)

## Roadmap
![NIT](https://github.com/nitnetwork/papers/blob/main/img/NIT_roadmap.png "New Information Technologies")

## Economy

__Overview__
 
NIT is an ERC-20 token which is a key to NIT Protocol features. The original utility token of the NIT Network  - NIT Token, is used to pay compensation for operations (transactions) in the NIT ecosystem. NIT Token is separated until 0.00000001 and will be issued as ERC-20 basic compliant tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Moreover, in the next stages, it may be driven by our exclusive technology.
We have to give the economic stimulus to increase parties‚Äô interest to help and maintain the ecosystem. Maintaining the NIT Network requires computational, economic, and human resources. Providers of these resources would be compensated with NIT tokens ("economic mining"). 

NIT is intended to use a potential of equilibrium model for circulating supply. 

In the nearest future staking validators and delegators will secure the network by staking their NIT in smart contracts, used for network support (reach agreement and other contributions).

For every single transaction within a system (deploying of DAO, smart contracts, NFT certificates), a $2 fee will be paid to DAO Treasury. Thereafter the amount of the fee will be set by NIT DAO.


__The Usage Of The NIT Token__:
 
1. Transaction fees on the NIT Protocol: Tokens can be used for transactions payments and operations, especially creating DAOs, smart contracts, encoding and decoding data into blockchains - creating NFT Certificates. In addition, users will get a discount for paying fees with NIT tokens;
2. NIT Token is a utility token that plays the role of the unit of payment and settlement between parties within the NIT ecosystem; 
3. Trading: NIT Token can be exchanged for other types of cryptocurrencies on different trades;
4. Loans and transfers: NIT can be used as collateral for loans on particular platforms;
5. Staking: NIT can be staked creating the opportunity for holders to get passive earnings;

__Allocation__

One billion NIT tokens will be minted at the genesis and will become available over 10 years. Each year 10% of tokens with a two-year lock and vesting period are circulated.  


The first 10-year allocation of NIT Token is as follows:

- Individuals and groups of 200,000,000 NIT; 
- Core team and future workers - 200,000,000 NIT;
- Treasury - 200,000,000 NIT; 
- Liquidity providers - 150,000,000 NIT (according to year snapshot);
- Founders - 100,000,000 NIT;
- DAO - 100,000,000 NIT;
- Airdrops - 25,000,000 NIT (according to year snapshot);
- Users of Telegram,Discord,Twitter - 25,000,000 NIT.

At genesis year 10% NIT tokens will be distributed with a two-year lock as follows:

- Individuals and groups - 20,000,000 NIT with a 2-year vesting;
- Core team and future workers - 20,000,000 NIT with a 2-year vesting;
- Treasury - 20,000,000 NIT; 
- Liquidity providers - 15,000,000 NIT  (according to year snapshot);
- Founders - 10,000,000 NIT with a 2-year vesting;
- DAO - 10,000,000 NIT;
- Airdrops  - 2.5,000,000 NIT (according to year snapshot);
- Users of Telegram,Discord,Twitter - 2.5,000,000 NIT.

The Treasury pool will maintain a minimum of 20% [200,000,000 NIT] of token supply. Every year all unallocated tokens will go to a Treasury pool. To secure our ecosystem financially, to make it strong, and stand the possible crises in the world, we will continuously buy two gold types: physical and digital (Bitcoin). 

To make our token anti-inflationary and more in demand, we need to buy back and lock the NIT Tokens until 500 000 000 million tokens. In such a way, 50% of the overall supply will be locked but the last decision will be made by the supreme DAO governance which will decide the number of tokens to be burned, unlocked, minted, or exchanged. This election will need substantive Voting Power with a maximal supply, but no more than 1 billion NIT tokens.

See table for the schedule of forward token allocation*
*The dates of allocation can be changed a bit because of technical practicability.


NIT holders will participate in establishing a technological, simple ecosystem by voting on various proposals. Every user owns its level of Voting Power based on the amount or equivalent of NIT Tokens(1 to1). A community-driven NIT DAO unlocks a world of endless opportunities such as ecosystem grants and funding.

The distribution of more than 20% of tokens, decentralization, technologically maturing, and compliance will give the start to the DAO supreme governance. Our lowest goal is 50% decentralization by the end of 2027. Nowadays the administration of the root contracts is centralized and under the control of a multisig with founders as keyholders and most popular influencers in the blockchain community. 

This period will give the NIT community enough time to get familiar with the system of governance and start debates and discussions about possible governance proposals. 

NIT holders are liable for governance decision-making according to applicable laws and regulations. We will consult legal and regulatory professionals before implementing any particular proposals.

NIT holders will have abilities and ownership of: 

- NIT governance; 
- NIT Treasury & DAO funds;
- newit.eth ENS name. 

Initial DAO supreme governance parameters are the following: 

50% of NIT total tokens are distributed to achieve quorum;
25% +1 of the quorum is required to vote 'yes' for the proposal to be passed;
voting period of 14 days;
3-day timelock execution delay.

Being an element of the early governance process, NIT holders will bear genesis voting on a proposed NIT Digital Statute which is a set of rules and instructions for the NIT community and elections of the Advisory Board and Security Committee. Vote proposals will be open on September 1, 2026, with voting starting on September 9, 2025. Users will have a right to delegate their right to vote to a community member representing their opinions (call for delegates).

__DAO dApp__
The primary NIT DAO interface will be localized at dao.nit.network, where users can log in, create proposals, and vote.

__Snapshot__
Snapshot is a platform for voting outside of the chain that maintains free voting on proposals for holders of tokens. When both the proposals and the votes are stored on IPFS in the form of cryptographically signed messages, Snapshot enables safe and easily contested results.
NIT‚Äôs DAO uses Snapshot to host the proposals and votes which are created by the community.
Every time a proposal is open at dao.nit.network, it‚Äôs automatically duplicated on NIT‚Äôs Snapshot space. This allows the DAO to record and store proposals, votes, and results in a safe and decentralized form, and the results are displayed back on dao.nit.network. From the Snapshot space, users will be able to delegate their VP to other members of the community.

__NIT DAO__
NIT DAO is a secured platform to create and manage the collection of smart contracts which are essential to run a DAO. The NIT DAO backend will be created via our system NIT DAO. As a result, anytime a community passes a proposal in Snapshot, the Security Committee commits it to the Ethereum mainnet in NIT DAO
 
__Advisory Board (AB)__
It is a group of trusted individuals selected by the community whose function is to hold keys in a multi-sig wallet. The multi-sig is obligated to implement any passed votes with a mandatory action, like implementing a user's proposal or burning tokens.
It is supervised by the Security Committee, which has the authority to put on hold and annul any action taken by the Advisory Board.
Every on-chain transaction launched by the Advisory Board has an automated 72-hour delay before its completion, which enables the withdrawal of the transaction by the Security Committee or the Advisory Board.

Security Committee (SC)
Security Committee guarantees the security of NIT‚Äôs smart contract and has the task to supervise the Advisory Board‚Äôs work and respond to weakness and bug reports in any of NIT‚Äôs contracts.
It gathers founders and six reliable individuals elected by the community to hold keys in a multi-sig wallet.
Any time changes need to be made to the main smart contracts, they have to be unquestionably supported by the SC‚Äôs multi-sig. A minimum of one-half signatories is required with no opposite votes to make updates to the main smart contracts.
The SC can pause, resume, or cancel any action authorized by the Advisory Board.
The proposal to appoint or fire a member of the SC can be initiated by beginning a Governance proposal process on dao.nit.network.


We created an organization called The NIT For People in the USA for lawful representation of the DAO, such as the fulfillment of any tax responsibilities. The articles of incorporation empower token holders to assign and fire directors, as well as, to instruct the organization to take actions in the real world.

If you want to become an early contributor, you can claim exclusive NIT NFT‚Äôs which will allow you to get NIT tokens and exceptional DAO privileges (for example, private channels, airdrops). 

For the airdrop, you just need to have NIT tokens staked on your balance.
